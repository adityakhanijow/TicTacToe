### Git
The project is managed via git reposirtory.

The main workflow for changes goes something like this:

1. Fork the project into your account.
2. Clone the forked project reposirtory locally on your PC.
3. Create a new branch in the local repo.
4. Commit all the changes you do in the new branch in local repo.
5. When ready for a pr(Personal Request), push the commits of the new branch to the remote fork.
6. Create a pr(Personal Request) from the forked repo to merge your changes with the develop branch of the project.
7. Switch to develop branch on local repo.
8. Delete the new branch that you created on the local repo.
9. Set the project url as upstream in your local repo.
10. Update your local repo by pulling from upstream/develop to your local develop branch.
11. Repeat from step 3 and skip step 9.
