# TicTacToe
First experimental project involving AI, Networking, Android Development and General Game Development

## Prerequisites

### Git
The project is managed via git reposirtory.

The main workflow for changes goes something like this:

1. Fork the project into your account.
2. Clone the forked project reposirtory locally on your PC.
3. Set the project url as upstream in your local repo.
4. Create a new branch in the local repo.
5. Commit all the changes you do in the new branch in local repo.
6. When ready for a pr(Personal Request), push the commits of the new branch to the remote fork repo.
7. Create a pr(Personal Request) from the forked repo to merge your changes with the develop branch of the project.
8. Switch to develop branch on local repo. 
9. Update your local repo by pulling from upstream/develop to your local develop branch.
10. Push the local develop branch to the remote fork repo.
11. Repeat from step 3.

NOTE: Whenever a pr gets merged or closed, delete the branch from which you created pr from your local repo and then also delete it from your fork repo.

There are many good tutorials online to learn C++. Just google "Learn GUI C++ for beginners".
